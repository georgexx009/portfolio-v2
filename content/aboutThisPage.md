title: 'About this page'

Currently, I'm still working on my projects and putting into practice new things that I'm learning. **At first my intention was just to learn and practice.** Now since I want to show what I'm doing I'm refactoring and cleaning my code to show it in my repositories. That is the reason why you may find some things that are incomplete.

I have a portfolio made in React.js and Webpack, but since the client side was rendering the page it was really slow. So, I made this webpage with **React.js and Next.js to improve page load.**

To style my projects, **I don't use any framework,** I just use SCSS. I found this way to keep practicing CSS really useful.

I made a REST API web server to provide a back end to my projects. The server is made with **Node.js + Express.js.** Use the **Mongoose Object Modeling Tool** to model the data and connect to the database. The **mongo database** is stored in a cloud provided by mLab.

For testing i use **Jest and Enzyme,** before I was using mocha and chai but for React, Jest seems to work better.
