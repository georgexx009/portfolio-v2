title: 'About me'
---

If I could describe myself in one word, would be **passionate**. I love technology, I’m passionate about learning new technologies and creating solutions through code.

**When I solve a problem or create something, either through code or by some other means, I find a feeling of happiness and satisfaction that only helps me confirm why I love this so much.**

Time ago, my way of thinking was that I will sleep when I’m dead, trying to do everything, learning everything. I forgot why I started, I forgot to have fun and enjoy what I was doing. Until I got burn. So I started to look for a better way of managing my life.

I found **Minimalism and Essentialism**, these two though me how to live a meaningful life and focus on the important things. Currently, I’m working on improving my habits and my time management. Focusing on what really matters. I don't just apply these principles to my life, I realized that if I also apply them to my career, I could get better results.
