title: 'About me'

If I could describe my self in one word, would be **passionate**. I love technology and I’m passionate about learning how things work and how to create things to provide elegant solutions. I like to read about programming languages, about new technologies coming up, listening to other developers talk about their experiences. When I solve a problem or create something, either through code or some other means, **I found a feeling of happiness and satisfaction that only helps me confirm why I love this so much.**

Time ago, my way of thinking was that I will sleep when I’m dead, trying to do everything, learning everything. I forgot why I started, I forgot to have fun and enjoy what I was doing. Until I got burn. So I started to look for a better way of managing my life.

I found **Minimalism and Essentialism**, these two though me how to live a meaningful life and focus on the important things. Currently, I’m working on improving my habits and my time management. Focusing on what really matters. I don't just apply these principles to my life, I realized that if I also apply them to my career, I could get better results.
